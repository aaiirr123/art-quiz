# Art Quiz
This was a project I completed for the course "Learn React" by Scrimba https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact

This project was based off of a "meme-generator" react app created in the course. Instead of following along and creating the same project, I decided to branch out and explore some of the react functionality I learned.

This art quiz connects to an API hosted by the met museum https://metmuseum.github.io/
Through this, I am able to collect images and data on different artists to then test users.
